### Overview

“High-performing engineering teams” are the Holy Grail for every CTO. But what are they, are they attainable, and if so, how? In this talk, we’ll look at CI/CD data from over 15mil anonymous workflows and compare it against the last few years on the CircleCI platform, and explore this rare specimen in its native habitat – right there in your organization, and how to activate them using some better DevOps and Continuous Delivery practices.
